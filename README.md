DragonWarriorJS - A recreation of Dragon Warrior for the NES in JavaScript
==========================================================================
Like it says on the tin.  This reproduction will try to be as authentic as
possible, warts and all.

What's (mostly) done:

* Map loading, motion, moving in and out of towns
* Collision detection
* Conversations with NPCs
* Sound (uses WebAudio, so Firefox and Chrome only for now)

What's currently being worked on (half-baked):

* Staying overnight at an inn
* Buying goods from a shop
* Battling an enemy

# To test this out
For the time being, you'll need to run this from a local Apache server, or some other
means of avoiding 
# To-Do
This project is in serious need of modernization.  On the to-do list includes:

* Conversion to webpack
* Conversion to TypeScript
* Updating gtp to 2.0.0
* Actual game stuff
