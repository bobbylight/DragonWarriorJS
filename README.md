# DragonWarriorJS - A recreation of Dragon Warrior for the NES in TypeScript
Like it says on the tin.  This reproduction will try to be as authentic as
possible, warts and all.

What's (mostly) done:

* Map loading, motion, moving in and out of towns
* Collision detection
* Conversations with NPCs
* Sound (uses WebAudio, so Firefox and Chrome only for now)

What's currently being worked on (half-baked):

* Staying overnight at an inn
* Buying goods from a shop
* Battling an enemy

# To test this out

```bash
npm install
npm run watch
# View http://localhost:8080
```
